## üê≤ AO20 Client üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Welcome to the source code repository for the Argentum20 Client. This client is a part of the larger Argentum Online game ecosystem. To fully utilize this client, you will need the corresponding server and assets:

- **Server:** [Argentum Online Server](https://github.com/ao-org/argentum-online-server)
- **Assets:** [Resources](https://github.com/ao-org/Recursos)

## üõ°Ô∏è Contributing via Pull Requests

We encourage contributions to the project! However, to maintain code quality and readability, please adhere to our guidelines, especially when dealing with the peculiarities of Visual Basic 6 IDE, which tends to change variable names, complicating the review process for Pull Requests.

### Setting Up Pre-commit Hooks

We utilize a pre-commit hook to minimize issues with variable name changes and other potential conflicts. Follow these steps to set up your environment correctly:

1. Open `git bash` or your preferred git client.
2. Execute the following commands:

```bash
chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

This pre-commit hook executes the `git_ignore_case.sh` script during a `git commit`, helping to avoid false changes in Pull Requests. While it's not a perfect solution, it significantly aids in keeping our project clean and review-friendly.

### If You Encounter Issues

If you have any trouble setting up the pre-commit hook locally, you can manually run the `git_ignore_case.sh` script by double-clicking on it. This step ensures that your contributions are as clean and straightforward as possible.

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the AO20 Client. By following these guidelines, you help us maintain a high standard of code quality and ensure that your contributions can be efficiently reviewed and integrated.
